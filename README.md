# Road Accident Analysis
## objective
To analyze road accident data using SQL Server, Excel, and Power BI to identify key patterns such as accident frequency, severity, and influencing factors like time, location, and weather. The goal is to develop a data-driven dashboard for insights that can support accident prevention strategies.
### Tools Used
**SQL Server** – For querying and data preparation
**Excel** – For initial data cleaning and transformation
**Power BI** – For data visualization and dashboard creation
## process
### Data Understanding
  Reviewed each column for meaning.
  Identified dimensions.
### Data Cleaning (in Excel & SQL)
  Handled date and time formatting
  Standardized text entries##
  Filtered null or inconsistent values
### Data Loading
  Imported cleaned data into SQL Server for querying and aggregations
  Linked Power BI to SQL for live visual analysis
### Analysis Performed
  Total number of accidents
  Accidents by day of the week and time of day
  Accident severity distribution
  Common accident junction types and road conditions
  Vehicle types involved in accidents
  Top areas with highest accidents
  Impact of weather and light conditions
### Dashboard Creation
    Designed interactive visuals in Power BI
    Used slicers (filters) for: day of week, accident severity, weather, vehicle type, road surface
### KPIs 
  How many accidents occurred in total?
  What is the distribution of accident severity (Slight, Serious, Fatal)?
  Which day of the week sees the most accidents?
  At what time do most accidents occur?
  What are the most common road surface and weather conditions during accidents?
  Which vehicle types are involved in the most accidents?
  What is the total number of casualties and vehicles involved?
  Which junction types are more accident-prone?
  Which local authority has the highest number of accidents?
